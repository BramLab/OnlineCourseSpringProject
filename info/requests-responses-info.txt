How to Use the Updated .http File:
First, run the login request (the one with # @name login)
This will capture the token automatically using the response handler

Then run any other request that uses {{auth_token}}
The token will be automatically inserted

The token is saved globally so it persists across all requests in the file


Key Features:
Response handlers (> {% ... %}) capture the token automatically
Global variables (client.global.set()) make it available everywhere
No manual copy-paste needed
Logging shows when the token is captured


Tips:
Always run a login request first to capture the token
If you get 401 errors, the token might have expired - run login again
You can switch between different user roles by running their respective login requests
The {{auth_token}} variable works in all requests after capture
